    "> You can think of a function as a small program inside a program.  The basic idea of a function is that we write a sequence of statements and give that sequence a name. The instructions can then be executed at any point in the program by referring to the function name… when a function is subsequently used in a program, we say that the definition is called or invoked.  \n",

    "Functions make coding easier to write, read and maintain. They reduce repetition and provide discrete mini-programs that once written and tested can be used over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been using Python functions since the start...`print` is a function! But the really cool thing is that **you** can (and should) write functions too! Functions are not complicated or limited to people with special skills. Conversely they can make your coding much easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "Two good indication of times to write a function is when you are tempted to copy and paste code from one section into another to re-use it, or when you think \"in this part of my code, I need to do this thing....\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The repeated code can likely be made into a function and called when needed. And the \"thing\" that needs to be done can also likely be written as a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Break programs down into functions to make them easier to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human beings can only keep a few items in working memory at a time.\n",
    "* Understand larger/more complicated ideas by understanding and combining pieces.\n",
    "    * Components in a machine.\n",
    "    * Lemmas when proving theorems.\n",
    "* Functions serve the same purpose in programs.\n",
    "    * *Encapsulate* complexity so that we can treat it as a single \"thing\".\n",
    "* Also enables *re-use*.\n",
    "    * Write one time, use many times.\n",

    "## 1.1. The Function as Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "![Practicum AI Logo image](images/relationship_agreement.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Big Bang Theory TV series, the show's resident genius - Sheldon Cooper - enjoys creating legally-binding agreements that specify the particulars of any relationship he is presently in. His romance with Amy is regulated by a relationship agreement, as is his relationship with his roommate, Leonard Hofstadter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental concept behind functions is the notion of a contract. Just as Sheldon's relationship and roommate agreements ensure that the parties involved will act in regular and predictable ways, so too the interface to a function is like a contract. If a call to a function passes the correct arguments in the correct order, a well written function responds in a predictable way, providing the promised output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Define a function using `def` with a name, parameters, and a block of code\n",
    "\n",
    "* Begin the definition of a new function with `def`.\n",
    "* Followed by the name of the function.\n",
    "    * Must obey the same rules as variable names.\n",
    "* Then *parameters* in parentheses.\n",
    "    * Empty parentheses if the function doesn't take any inputs.\n",
    "* Then a colon.\n",
    "* Then an indented block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can define a function using `def`:\n",
