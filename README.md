The vast majority of hands-on artificial intelligence work is currently done using the Python programming language. As such, *some* understanding of Python, in particular, and computer programming, in general, is needed to be successful in applying AI. That said, it is truly astounding how much complex AI research can be accomplished with a few lines of code!

The content in this repository is aimed at beginning coders who may have never programmed before. As with the rest of the *Practicum AI* workshops, we use Jupyter Notebooks for the learning experience. Jupyter Notebooks are an easy to use, yet powerful tool that allow interactive coding as well as nicely formatted explanatory text. Much of exploratory AI research is conducted in Jupyter notebooks, and it is easy to transfer code from notebooks to scripts when it is time to scale up analyses.

## Introduction to Python Workshop Learning Objectives

* Navigate within the Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab environment
* Create a new Python script
* Create a Jupyter notebook
* Understand the difference between a Python script and a Jupyter notebook
* Create Markdown cells in a notebook
* Create and run Python cells in a notebook
* Understand the rules which govern Python variable behavior
* Write simple programs that assign values to variables and perform calculations with those values
* Correctly trace variable changes in a Python program
* Explain key differences between integers and floating point numbers
* Explain key differences between numbers and character strings
* Explain the purpose of functions
* Correctly call built-in Python functions
* Correctly nest calls to built-in functions
* Use help to display documentation for built-in functions
* Correctly describe situations in which SyntaxError and NameError occur
* Explain what software libraries are and why programmers create and use them
* Write programs that import and use modules from Python's standard library
* Find and read documentation for the standard library interactively (in the interpreter) and online
* Import the `Pandas` or `cudf` library
* Use `Pandas` or `cudf` to load a simple CSV data set
* Get some basic information about a `Pandas` or `cudf` DataFrame
* Select individual values from a dataframe
* Select entire rows or entire columns from a dataframe
* Select a subset of both rows and columns from a dataframe in a single operation
* Select a subset of a dataframe by a single Boolean criterion
* Select and transform data and then plot it
Plot data directly from a dataframe
* Create a time series plot showing a single data set
* Create a scatter plot showing relationship between two data sets
* Explain why programs need collections of values
* Write programs that create flat lists, index them, slice them, and modify them through assignment and method calls
* Explain what for loops are normally used for
* Trace the execution of a simple (unnested) loop and correctly state the values of variables in each iteration
* Write for loops that use the Accumulator pattern to aggregate values
* Correctly write programs that use if and else statements and simple Boolean expressions (without logical operators)
* Trace the execution of unnested conditionals and conditionals inside loops
* Explain and identify the difference between function definition and function call
* Write a function that takes a small, fixed number of arguments and produces a single result
* Provide sound justifications for basic rules of coding style
* Refactor one-page programs to make them more readable and justify the changes
* Use Python community coding standards (PEP-8)
