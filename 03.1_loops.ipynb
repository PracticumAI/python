    "But, computers don't get bored! We will look at two main types of loops:\n",

    "1. `for` loops: *for* each item in a list of items, do something\n",

    "If we had to find the longest word on each line of a big book, we'd quickly get tired! Buy, if we ask the computer to do this, it will happily comply. All we need to do is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Give the computer a list (of the lines in the book)\n",
    "   1. Tell it what we want it to do for each item in the list (find the longest word)\n",
    "      * Note that this could be written as nested loop: Once the computer gets a line, make a new loop to look at each word of that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another step toward putting this into code would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "For every line in this book,\n",

    "  and save information about that word in a variable\n",
