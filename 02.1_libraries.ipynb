    "    * Library's contents are supposed to be related, but there's no way to enforce that.\n",
    "* The Python [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) is an extensive suite of modules that comes with Python itself.\n",
    "* Many additional libraries are available from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/) (the Python Package Index).\n",

    "A library is a collection of modules, but **the terms are often used interchangeably**, especially since many libraries only consist of a single module.\n",

    "### 1.2 A program must import a library module before using it\n",

    "* Use `import` to load a library module into a program's memory.\n",

    "    * Python uses `.` to mean \"part of\".\n",
