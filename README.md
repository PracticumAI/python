Welcome! This repository is a more in-depth look at Python than the *Practicum AI: Python for AI* course ([Course](https://practicumai.org/courses/python/) and [repository](https://github.com/PracticumAI/python-for-ai)). For *Python for AI* we actually started with this course and trimmed out as much as possible to be as focused as possible on the *minimum content* needed to get started with AI. 

This course retains all that content, covering important programming constructs like loops, conditionals, string slicing, and more. These are important concepts and would certainly help with AI research, but we made hard decisions to trim them out as they were not absolutely required. 

We hope you enjoy this expanded content!

The content in this workshop is aimed at beginning coders who may have never programmed before. As with the rest of the *Practicum AI* workshops, we use Jupyter Notebooks for the learning experience. Jupyter Notebooks are an easy to use, yet powerful tool that allow interactive coding as well as nicely formatted explanatory text. Much of exploratory AI research is conducted in Jupyter Notebooks, and it is easy to transfer code from Notebooks to scripts when it is time to scale up analyses.
