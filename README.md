# Introduction to Python Workshop

The vast majority of hands-on artificial intelligence work is currently done using the Python programming language. As such, *some* understanding of Python, in particular, and computer programming, in general, is needed to be successful in applying AI. That said, it is truly astounding how much complex AI research can be accomplished with a few lines of code!

The content in this repository is aimed at beginning coders who may have never programmed before. As with the rest of the *Practicum AI* workshops, we use Jupyter Notebooks for the learning experience. Jupyter Notebooks are an easy to use, yet powerful tool that allow interactive coding as well as nicely formatted explanatory text. Much of exploratory AI research is conducted in Jupyter notebooks, and it is easy to transfer code from notebooks to scripts when it is time to scale up analyses.

### Workshop Learning Objectives (*Python*)

#### Session 1
1. Navigate within the Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab environment.
2. Create a Jupyter notebook.
3. Create a Python script.
4. Explain the difference between a Python script and a Jupyter notebook.
5. Explain the advantages of Jupyter Lab versus a traditional integrated development environment (IDE).
6. Create Markdown cells in a notebook.
7. Create and run Python cells in a notebook.
8. Create a basic Hello World!
9. Demonstrate basic mathematical operations.

#### Session 2
1. Explain the rules which govern Python variable behavior.
2. Create a program that assigns values to a variable and perform calculations with those variables.
3. Explain reserved keywords in Python.
4. Trace variable changes within a program.
5. Explain the key differences between numbers and character strings.
6. Explain the key differences between integers and floating point numbers.
7. Manipulate character strings and numbers within variables.
8. Explore the help, dir, and type related to string and variables.
9. Demonstrate string indexing.
10. Describe situations in which SyntaxError and NameError occur.

#### Session 3
1. Explain the purpose of functions.
2. Explain and identify the difference between a function definition and a function call.
2. Write a function that takes a small, fixed number of arguments and produces a single result.
3. Use help to display documentation for built-in functions.
4. Explain the concept of iteration.
5. Explore and explain purpose of conditionals and loops.
6. Correctly call built-in Python functions.
7. Correctly nest calls to built-in functions.
8. Explain indention in Python.
9. Write for loops that use the Accumulator pattern to aggregate values.
10. Trace the execution of a simple (unnested) loop and correctly state the values of variables in each iteration.
11. Discuss related best practices for coding.


#### Session 4
1. Explain data management.
2. Explain what software libraries are and why programmers use them.
3. Discuss and explore Pandas DataFrames.
4. Import the Pandas or cudf library.
5. Find and read documentation for the standard library interactively (in the interpreter) and online.
6. Write a program that imports and uses modules from Python's standard library.
7. Write a program that uses if and else if statements and simple Boolean expressions (without logical operators).
8. Work with data from a .csv file.
